# SCU Robotics Systems Lab Senior Design Project
Senior Design Project for SCU's Robotics Systems Lab (RSL)\
------------------------------------------------------------------\
This project is developing a cobot which can autonomously navigate obstacle-filled interior environments\
such as commercial kitchens. The goal is to create the foundation for a cobot autonomous navigation system\
which can be used in future RSL projects.\
This repository contains the source code of the cobot, but excludes any external libraries not developed by the team.
