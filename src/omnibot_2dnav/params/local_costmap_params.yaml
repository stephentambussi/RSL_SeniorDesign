#Config for local costmap: for local planning and obstacle avoidance
#All ranges/distances are in meters

local_costmap:
  global_frame: odom #what coordinate frame the costmap should run
  robot_base_frame: base_link #coordinate frame for the base of the robot
  update_frequency: 5.0 #Hz -- frequency at which update loop will run
  publish_frequency: 2.0 #Hz -- frequency at which costmap will publish visualization info
  static_map: false #determines whether costmap should initialize itself based on preexisting map
  rolling_window: true #whether costmap will remain centered around robot as it moves through world
  width: 6.0 #width of costmap
  height: 6.0 #height of costmap
  resolution: 0.05 #meters/cell -- should be same resolution as static map (but fine if not)
