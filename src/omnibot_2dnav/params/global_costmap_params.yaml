#Config for global costmap: creating long-term plans over the entire environment

global_costmap:
  global_frame: /robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined
  #global_frame: /odom
  robot_base_frame: /base_footprint #coordinate frame for the base of the robot
  update_frequency: 15.0 #Hz -- frequency at which update loop will run
  publish_frequency: 15.0
  resolution: 0.05
  static_map: false #determines whether costmap should initialize itself based on preexisting map
  rolling_window: true #whether costmap will remain centered around robot as it moves through world
  width: 5.0 #width of costmap
  height: 5.0 #height of costmap
  resolution: 0.1 #meters/cell -- should be same resolution as static map (but fine if not)
